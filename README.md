# About me

## Introduction
Hello, my name is David Ali. I currently work as a courier. I like to spend my free time on different projects including web developement, C++ programming, writing and playing music (I play the guitar for ~20 years). Recently I got injured at work due to heavy lifting, therefore I would like to find a job where my spine is safe.

## Goal
My dream is to become a computer software developer, a professional musician, or - why not both? - a sound engineer.

## Project ideas
- Terminal based C++ project manager.
- Professional software for musicians who choose to use Linux as their workstation.
- Online VR community software for musicians.
- Web based problem solving platform: users can query their requests and offer a price for the solution and at the same time they can browse other requests and solve them for the reward.
- Web based recipe/tutorial sharing platform.
- Web platform for artists, so they can reach their audience easily while focusing on their artwork instead of technical difficulties.

## Why am I here on GIT?
I need to learn to use different popular tools - like GIT - to be able to find a job in IT.

## Inspiration
Feel free to wish me good luck to reach my goals. Every positive word pushes me forward on the road to become who I always wanted to.
